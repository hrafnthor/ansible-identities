          ]
```

##### Password

When setting the password for a user, it is possible to include the password directly in the `value` field or by using the `variable` field to look it up form variables in the Ansible run. This can be beneficial when not wanting to expose password hashes directly in the playbook, and rather have the value be read into a variable (for instance from a Vault) at runtime. If neither `variable` nor `value` is present, the user will receive a password (i.e '!') and not be able to log in.

#### Example:

```yaml
identities:
  root:
    login: false
  groups:
  - id: 1234
    name: Ã¦sir
    state: absent
  - name: vanir
  users:
  - id: 6666
    name: Loki
    password:
      variable: super_secret_password
  - id: 7777
    name: Freyja
    comment: "Godess of home and hearth"
    password:
      value: "$6$pnrja6mdaIDRT8jY$ZXUTacmWsztweowb3NIjS95EhIlfLv4OwncWtHK0AubenlLExhKTeuf/B/FQK4PX0mIzHdhwSoJNssbrndacU/"
      policy: always
    groups:
    - vanir
    - gods
    - sudo
    shell: "/bin/fish"
    home:
      mode: "0777" # Only Freyja should do this!
